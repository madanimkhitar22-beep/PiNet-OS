# PiNet OS

**PiNet OS** is a quantum-secure, AI-powered decentralized operating layer forming the core infrastructure of the **Pi Ecosystem**, fully integrated with **PiTrust** (Identity Layer) and **PiBridge** (Migration Layer) under the **PiOS Governance Framework**.

It provides the operating backbone that enables cross-chain functionality, decentralized identity, and smart governance coordination — built with Moroccan precision, institutional transparency, and global standards.
